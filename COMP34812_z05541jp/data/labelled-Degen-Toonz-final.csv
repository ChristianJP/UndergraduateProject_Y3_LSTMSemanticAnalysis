Of course, you're still in for the ride, and I believe you will still get some good profit on your investment, even if you bought the top, but try to remember to look into everything before FOMOing in, floor prices unfortunately don't infinitely go up hahaha, as much as that'd be awesome to see.

701904966486589543,Mr.eth#3208,04-Mar-22 18:48,do you buy things because you like them or because they are rare? I don't think toonz robots are beautiful and they are rare,,,,
710187619627302912,SugarShacked#5325,04-Mar-22 18:48,I think rarity will play a role as we move up but only within the top 10% toonz and then golds and robots,,,,
710187619627302912,SugarShacked#5325,04-Mar-22 18:49,but right now people are purely buying for aesthetics outside of gold skin and robot,,,,

929597006949789746,Chazamcnaza#4199,04-Mar-22 18:55,If it gets to that stage our whales will sweep.. it helps their investment 👍,,,,
810327511740448779,Crimson_#8600,04-Mar-22 18:56,For sure. But whether someone is willing to pay 5th because they love whatever basic toon you’re holding is moot if it’s listed low like other basic toons. Not listing or listing way above floor is the only way to go,,,,

What differs stocks from NFTs? 
Stocks are actual businesses with people that make decisions, and have profits, etc.
They have balance sheets, a product or service...

In NFTs, it's different because:
1. NFTs are also a product
2. All investors are also a part of that brand

Who you are, what you say, and what you do will either increase or decrease the value of that brand.

When you're worried about Floor Price, you need to identify:
1. Is the market down? Are people scared? Because if they are, they will sell at a loss or at a low price to get liquidity. That's how people make money in bad markets: they are already liquid and they buy from people who sell low.

2. Is the team good? Are they working towards their goals? If you think they are, then great! You're betting on the team. Hold it until it goes up. If you don't, that's another thing.

3. Is the community building the brand? Are they helping make this project grow? Are they using their PFPs, building brands with them, etc? If yes, then that's a good sign!

4. How's the activity? If there are little or no sells, you can be a little concerned. If there's a constant buy/sell going on, it means people are into it. And the market is moving.",,🚀 (12),,

How do you increase brand value?
- Do what you do best, and slap the Toonz on it. 

If you're a content creator, do that at your best with a Toon personality.
If you're a designer, use it to create art or designs for Toonz.
If you're a developer, think about solutions that will serve the Toonz communities.
If you're a financial advisor, go on Twitter Spaces with your Toon pfp and give advice to other people.

People will respect you. And they will want to become what you are. And the first thing that you will show them is a Toon. So they'll want to be closer to you in this community

Listen to this: Let’s take Apocalyptic Apes for example. I’ve done my homework, and have been watching their discord of 22,000 members closely. 3 days ago their floor price was 0.45. TODAY their floor price is 1.05.

HOW DID THEY ACHIEVE THIS? It’s very simple. Every single holder in their discord promised to list at 1 ETH. Everyone refused offers under 1 ETH. I watched them talk about this. I watched it happen. I watched the floor price go up with my very eyes. And now outside people are paying 1.25 eth to get one fire, 

Another project is MAYC. The all agreed on listing high or to delist. Floor went from 6 ETH to 16 ETH wink

FOR EXAMPLE: IF WE ALL AGREE to list our Kidz at 3 eth the LOWEST  will sell for $7,500!!!! no matter what!!! WE ALL MAKE 4 FIGURES IF WE SELL AT THAT LIST PRICE, EVEN THE LOWEST RANKED.

We all have such an easy opportunity here to make so much money. It’s as simple as everyone agreeing on a list price. I’ve done my research and watched what other discord communities are doing to bring their floor price up. THIS STRATEGY WORKS! Especially with the unique artwork we have.

887421411168227379,ParkDanks#5272,09-Mar-22 2:48,People try to act like they can analyze all the price patterns,,,,

887421411168227379,ParkDanks#5272,09-Mar-22 2:50,Seems like pre reveal is a good time to sell because a lot of FOMO and it gets pumped up,,,,

708491401972678798,Reksir#5971,09-Mar-22 6:41,Idk what that is,,,,
396090594792964105,Tone#1614,09-Mar-22 7:14,Did it for a while. Extremely hard to actually get a profitable store up and running. A lot of “influencers” for dropshipping simply use the business model to sell their own course on it which makes them the actual money you see in their videos. Not impossible but a highly saturated business model that is gonna take creativity and perseverance to make it work. My .02 cents! I believe in you!,,,,
475554126168850432,Ascher#0984,09-Mar-22 7:17,"Thanks man! Personally me and a couple of my clients have developed a couple 8 figure dropshipping business models… I will say once you have a winning product and automated marketing cycles, it’s all passive income! Pretty great",,,,

396090594792964105,Tone#1614,09-Mar-22 7:20,Literally. I never felt like I could find a winning product and win I did I felt wrong about it because it was something like the black air pods where the quality was shitty and totally against trademarks. Felt morally wrong at some points but only if I got involved with the wrong product.,,,,
